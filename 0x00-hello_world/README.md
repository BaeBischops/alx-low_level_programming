<h1>ALX Low-Level Programming - 0x00 Hello World</h1>

Welcome to my ALX Low-Level Programming 0x00 Hello World repository. This project contains my own solutions and code for the introductory tasks in the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. These programs cover various fundamental aspects of the C programming language and serve as a starting point for more advanced topics in low-level programming.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
As an ALX student, I have successfully completed the 0x00 Hello World project by implementing the required C programs. These programs aim to demonstrate my understanding of concepts like basic I/O, compilation, and using essential C functions.
