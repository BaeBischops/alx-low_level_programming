<h1>ALX Low-Level Programming - 0x00 Hello World</h1>

Welcome to my ALX Low-Level Programming 0x00 Hello World repository. This project contains my own solutions and code for the introductory tasks in the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. These programs cover various fundamental aspects of the C programming language and serve as a starting point for more advanced topics in low-level programming.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
As an ALX student, I have successfully completed the 0x00 Hello World project by implementing the required C programs. These programs aim to demonstrate my understanding of concepts like basic I/O, compilation, and using essential C functions.

<h3>Repository Contents</h3>
Here is a list of the C programs and their descriptions that I have completed as part of this project:
<ul>
    <li>0-preprocessor: This program showcases the use of the C preprocessor and includes header files.</li>
    <li>1-compiler: It introduces the concept of compilation using the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and explores the -E, -c, and -o flags.</li>
    <li>2-assembler: This program helps in understanding the assembly code generated during the compilation process.</li>
    <li>3-name: It prints the name of the file it was compiled from.</li>
    <li>4-puts.c: Using the puts function, it prints a string.</li>
    <li>5-printf.c: Demonstrating the use of the printf function to print formatted strings.</li>
    <li>6-size.c: This program prints the size of various data types on your system.</li>
</ul>
